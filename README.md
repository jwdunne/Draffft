# Draffft
A simple lightweight blog app built for SCMF

[Click here for a demo](http://devxdev.com/blog)

## Requirements
* SCMF   1.2.0+
* PHP    5.4
* MySQL  5.0+
* Apache 2
* mod_rewrite

## Installation
For the time being you just need to run an SQL file through your DB to add
all the proper settings and tables. There are two ways of editing the settings,
open the SQL file and edit the settings (outlining later), or use cli/RDBMS

**Note** Setup files are not being released until SCMF hits RC1 (1.2.3)

## License
Released under APL v2, See LICENSE for more. Basically I don't really care as long as you give back improvements.

I'm pretty carefree and just enjoy writting OSS, you should enjoy using it.
